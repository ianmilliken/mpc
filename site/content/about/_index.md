  body: >-
    Marketplace Strategy Solutions is a Brisbane based, full service marketing
    agency, servicing South East Queensland and the greater Australian business
    community.


    With over 30 years in the marketplace, we know better than most that
    businesses have to adapt to keep kicking goals, and it’s exactly the support
    we can provide to you and your business.


    Once with a big focus on public relations and advertising back in the 90's,
    our skill set has expanded over time to incorporate things like digital
    marketing, website development and social media management, whilst still
    keeping a few traditional tricks up our sleeve, like the invaluable
    marketing plan, advertising campaigns and creative design.


    From developers to retailers, lawyers to architects, we’ve worked with such
    a diverse range of Queensland and Australian businesses, and evolved to
    ensure our clients are best equipped to handle any of their marketing and
    business growth needs.


    We like to think our story is best told by the words of our happy clients.
