  title: Our Story
  highlight: A full service marketing agency
  body: >-
    Marketplace Strategy Solutions is a full service marketing agency, with over
    25 years experience.


    We know better than most that businesses have to adapt to keep kicking goals,
    and it’s exactly the support we can provide to you and your business.


    Once with a big focus on public relations (back when newspapers weren’t fly
    swatters) our skill set has expanded over time to things like digital
    marketing, website development and social media management, whilst still
    keeping a few traditional tricks up our sleeve, like the invaluable
    marketing plan, advertising campaigns and creative design.


    From developers to retailers, lawyers to architects, we’ve worked with such
    a diverse range of Australian businesses, and evolved and grown to ensure
    our clients are best equipped to handle any of their marketing and business
    growth needs.


    We like to think our story is told best by the stories of our happy clients.
