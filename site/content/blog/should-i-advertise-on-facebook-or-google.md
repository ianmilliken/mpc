## First of all, why do it?

Pay per click (PPC) advertising is a great way to 'jump the queue' when it comes to getting in front of your target market.

Currently, you might not be the first thing that comes to mind when they think of your product/service category, but carefully placed ads can ensure that you're the first thing they see.

But where to advertise? Google and Facebook are the biggest PPC marketplaces and it's worth a look at whether they're both good options for your business, or in fact one fits you better than the other.

## The advertising options

You have to take a good look at what you're selling to determine whether Google or Facebook's advertising options are better for you. For example, Facebook offers a be

**Google**

Google's advertising options have remained largely unchanged for many years, with the most popular choice being 'search ads' that appear in place of a regular search result. 

* Search ads - lookalike Google search results, appearing at the top of searches
* Banner/display ads - image heavy ads that appear on a range of websites
* Ads that will appear across a range of apps of your choosing

**Facebook**

When compared to Google, Facebook's advertising options are far more extensive, with sophisticated video/carousel ads used to showcase products/services visually.

* Link click ads -
* Photo ads -
* Video ads - 
* Carousel ads - showcasing multiple products

## Push vs pull

A fundamental aspect of marketing is whether you are having to 'push' your advertisements towards consumers, or whether they're in fact being 'pulled' towards them.

Having PPC ads on Google often means that you're advertising in front of someone who is actively searching for a product/service you offer - making the sell that much easier. Thus, a pull campaign.

Having PPC ads on Facebook means that you're advertising in front of someone who likes pages, and has purchase behaviour that matches your target market, but they're not necessarily looking for your product/service right now. Thus, a push campaign.

The difference between the two being that one user is highly motivated to click on your ad, whereas the other is more likely to be passive, unless the ad is so engaging that they're compelled to click through.

This distinction can be decisive in what kind of conversion rate your campaign receives, and how many clicks it gets overall.

With the right message and ad creative, any campaign can be successful, but considering the motivation level of your end user is critical in understanding what kind of results you should expect.

It's not to say that push campaigns are less effective, it just means that you often need to 'widen the net' and allow for a bigger target market to draw end users in.
