## First of all, why do it?

Pay per click (PPC) advertising is a great way to 'jump the queue' when it comes to getting in front of your target market.

Currently, you might not be the first thing that comes to mind when they think of your product/service category, but carefully placed ads can ensure that you're the first thing they see.

But where to advertise? Google and Facebook are the biggest PPC marketplaces and it's worth a look at whether they're both good options for your business, or in fact one fits you better than the other.

## Are the advertising options different?

Yes, absolutely. The two platforms offer wildly different ads for you to create so you really should nail down on what you need to advertise your product effectively.

Are you advertising a clothing line, that requires photos and images to get people interested?

Or is the appeal of your offer captured best by words, like a new price for your product?

Different types of ads across the different platforms will ultimately suit you better than others.

**Google**

* Want an ad that puts you ahead of competitors on important searches? Google's search network ads can make that happen
* Want an ad that gives you exposure on certain websites (i.e. a mechanic on automotive websites)? Google's display network ads make that possible
* Want an ad that promotes your products when people are shopping online? Google's shopping ads position your business perfectly

**Facebook**

* Want to get more traffic on your website? Facebook's link click ads will do the job
* Is getting more leads a priority? Facebook has lead generation ads that allow the user to fill out a form without leaving their feed
* Got a new product to promote? Facebook's photo and video ads do a great job of advertising products visually
* How about a whole line of products? Facebook's 'carousel' and 'collections' ads allow businesses to advertise as many as 5 products/offers at once
* Or do you just want more people to follow your page and your posts? Facebook's page and post like ads help you funnel traffic to your page

## Are the users' intentions different?

Yes.  Facebook and Google users are not equally likely to click on your ads. 

People go on Google to search for something, and if that search happens to be for a keyword your ad is targeting then you stand a good chance of being clicked on.

On the other hand, Facebook users are often just there to socialise, so your carousel ad for your new sneaker line may slip past their attention, despite the fact that they follow 20 other sneaker pages and fashion blogs. Frustrating we know!

A fundamental aspect of marketing is whether you are having to 'push' your advertisements towards consumers, or whether they're in fact being 'pulled' towards them.

Advertising on Google means that you're advertising in front of someone who is actively searching for a product/service you offer right now.

Advertising on Facebook means that you're advertising in front of someone who likes pages and has purchase behaviour that matches your target market - but right now they could have opened Facebook to post a selfie or look longingly at what their ex is up to. 

It's not to say that Facebook campaigns are less effective, it just means that you often need to 'narrow the market' down to a specific user to get better results, because of the diverse intentions of their user base.

With the right message and ad creative, any campaign can be successful, but considering the motivation level of your end user is critical in understanding what kind of results you should expect.

## So what's the answer?

There's no golden rule on which PPC platform is better - so consider the below before making your decision;

* More likely to click/convert? Google beats Facebook here with the average ROI being $2 per $1 spent on Google AdWords
* Targeting? Facebook allows you to tap into far more than just age/location, going as deep as page likes, job title, relationship status and more
* Audience? Google has a much greater reach than Facebook with over 3.5 billion unique searche per day
* Options for advertising? Facebook has the more dynamic options, with over 10 total ad types available
* Cost? Facebook has the edge over Google here, with the average cost per click as low as $1 per 4,000 impressions and daily mimimum spend at $1
