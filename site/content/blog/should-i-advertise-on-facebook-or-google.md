## Is there a golden rule for where to spend my budget?

Pay per click advertising is a great way to 'jump the queue' when it comes to getting in front of your target market.

Currently, you might not be the first thing that comes to mind when they think of your product/service category, but carefully placed ads can ensure that you're the first thing they see.

But where to advertise? Google and Facebook are the biggest PPC marketplaces and it's worth a look at whether they're both good options for your business, or in fact one fits you better than the other.

## Push vs pull

A fundamental aspect of marketing is whether you are having to 'push' your advertisements towards consumers, or whether they're in fact being 'pulled' towards them.

Having PPC ads on Google often means that you're advertising in front of someone who is actively searching for a product/service you offer - making the sell that much easier. Thus, a pull campaign.

Having PPC ads on Facebook means that you're advertising in front of someone who likes pages, and has purchase behaviour that matches your target market, but they're not necessarily looking for your product/service right now. Thus, a push campaign.

The difference between the two being that one user is highly motivated to click on your ad, whereas the other is more likely to be passive, unless the ad is so engaging that they're compelled to click through.

This distinction can be decisive in what kind of conversion rate your campaign receives, and how many clicks it gets overall.

With the right message and ad creative, any campaign can be successful, but considering the motivation level of your end user is critical in understanding what kind of results you should expect.

It's not to say that push campaigns are less effective, it just means that you often need to 'widen the net' and allow for a bigger target market to draw end users in.

## The ads themselves

The biggest difference however, is what the ads look like on each platform.

Google's most popular ad type is built to look like and be confused with a real search result - so it's very text heavy. 

Whereas Facebook's most popular ad type is a image/text combination ad, that appears in the middle of someone's feed.

So before you write Facebook off altogether, it's more dynamic ad capabilities may be just what you're looking for.

For a jewellery or clothing company, Facebook is often the perfect platform for their PPC ads, rather than Google, because
