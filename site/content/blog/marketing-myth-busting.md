## Think you know marketing? Think again...

Maybe your running your own marketing campaign and your go-to is google. This may be one of your biggest downfalls, a lot of people come to us with a multitude or different propositions that they’ve read off the internet. So, let’s bust a few myths.

## \#1 Having a website is good enough 

No more of this “if you build it, they will come” mentality. You must put yourself out there for people to notice you. Hundreds, maybe thousands of companies are competing with you on the web for your ideal client’s business.

If you are not putting yourself in front of them on that digital screen with valuable information that catches their eye and helps answer their questions, you most likely will not be discovered.

## \#3 I just need some SEO to get my website found

When we conduct competitor analysis SEO component is only 1 of an array analytical component that we look at. That is because SEO is only one factor that affects your company’s exposure to your audience. Don’t get me wrong, SEO is an extremely important part of your businesses marketing, but it alone isn’t enough to compete in today’s digital market.  

## \#5 Quantity is more important than quality

 A common fallacy for content marking is that quantity has the upper hand over quality. Whilst it is an integral part of marketing to be uploading frequent content so that Google rewards your organic growth, you also need to make sure that the quality of what you are publishing isn’t sub-par content that nobody wants to read. 

The bee-all and end-all is that quality trumps all. Quality is way more important than quantity in the eyes of consumers. Each piece of content that you create should have purpose that brings value to consumers. Don’t fall into old SEO tactics that don’t work.
