Marketplace Strategy Solutions (formerly Marketplace Communications) has gone through a lot of change since MD Patrick first brought his vision of an integrated marketing and communications agency to life over 30 years ago.

Kylie Minogue’s ‘Loco-motion’ had everyone boogieing; video rental stores like Blockbuster still had no inkling of their impending doom; and this is what the latest Apple computer looked like:

Yes, things have come along way since the 80’s, but as other agencies have come and gone Patrick and Marketplace Strategy Solutions have stood their ground to provide leading marketing solutions to Australian businesses.

What has changed for us though (aside from \[whatever is in the image]), is our approaches to helping businesses grow. As new means of marketing and technologies change the way businesses communicate in their markets, we’ve continued to develop new skills and solutions that help our clients take the advantage.

Our consistent focus on delivering the best in service has allowed Marketplace Strategy Solutions to adapt and thrive with the times, and this is what we wanted to showcase through our rebrand.

## Why the rebrand?

It seems as though we took the focus on our client service a little too far, as we suffered from the case of “we’re too busy to do our own marketing”. That left our website in 2017 outdated, our online presence barren and our brand image a bit out of touch with our focus on business growth strategies.

As complacency is not the Marketplace way, the team got together to brainstorm about implementing a new responsive website alongside a brand ‘refresh’. The brand refresh would encompass our strength in providing stand-out strategies whilst incorporating the striking Marketplace red branding that our client-base know well.

Our updated identity would present our same efforts to create new business opportunities for clients in creative ways, however it would also bring to the forefront Marketplace’s 30+ years expertise and ability to adapt in a ‘fresh’ way. 

And without further ado here are the results - we’d love to know what you think!

## Our name and branding

Marketplace Strategy Solutions

We felt that the “communications” aspect of Marketplace Communications limited our appeal and scope since “strategy” is the offering we really wanted to promote. So out with the old, in with the new - our new name Marketplace Strategy Solutions instantly describes what we offer in a targeted way.

## The Logo

Whilst keeping the same strong red in the Marketplace Communications branding in the equation, our logo has also undergone a big change to fit with our new name. With the “Communications” part of our branding no longer being as prominent a focus, we wanted to change the speech bubble of our logo to something that fit with our core mission to help businesses grow.

The team found that oak and bonsai trees act as a symbol of growth, whilst at the same time representing experience, maturity and careful nurturing. These trees were perfect representations of our experience as a marketing agency and our ability to help business adapt and grow to do big things.

In the end we chose to go with the bonsai due to its longevity and the masterful art that goes into its nurturing into something quite spectacular. 

## The new website

The aim of the new website was to make it as simple as possible for people to find out what marketing and business growth solutions would be the most beneficial for their situation.

We implemented this in a few ways; 

## To the next 30 years!

We think that these elements are a great foundation for us to create offerings that fits with our core values.
