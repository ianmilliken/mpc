In many ways it's never been easier to start a business and run it profitably than it is right now - so why do we still see businesses failing in the marketplace?

Changes in technology have cut overheads down in terms of marketing your business, managing your business' finances and even considering how many staff you employ, thanks to automation.

But failure is still rife in the business community.

There are a variety of reasons, and some are unique to the industry that business is in, so the following is a look at why businesses in the same industry fail.

They're dealing with the same customers. They're facing the same competitive forces. So what makes one fail and the other succeed?

We hope this will share some insight on how your business can avoid the former...

## Masters vs Bunnings

* No point of difference, or single unique aspect of their marketing.

The fact that Masters wasn't the first player in the hardware market wasn't the problem at hand.

Apple wasn't the first company to make computers or smart phones, just like Aldi wasn't close to being Australia's first supermarket.

But they both entered their respective markets with a clear point of difference, something Masters failed to do.

Consumers already had an established hardware offering from Bunnings and Masters failed to deliver a reason to switch.

Furthermore, Bunnings has had an effective marketing message in place for years via their price guarantee, and Masters wasn't able to create an offer that bested that for the market.

## Eagle Boys vs Dominos

* Failure to embrace technology and adapt alongside their target market

Dominos and Eagle Boys. Both big names in the fast food pizza scene a decade ago. Both franchise businesses with a national footprint. So why does one fail but not the other?

Here's a hint, it's got nothing to do with their pizza.

The short answer is Eagle Boys failed to deliver a new experience to their target market, which was growing out of old habits. 

Fast food pizza has always been a food experience enjoyed by the younger generations, no matter what era, and the inability of Eagle Boys to create a slick, reliable online ordering service was a major downfall for their business, as people opted to order on their phone instead of calling the business directly.

Not being able to keep up with your target market is a risk for every business out there, with the pace of technological advancements now measured in years, not decades.

Streamlined, online business is everywhere now, from having your groceries delivered to your door instead of going to the shops to booking an appointment with your GP online and the slow reaction of Eagle Boys to jump on this trends cost them in the long run.
