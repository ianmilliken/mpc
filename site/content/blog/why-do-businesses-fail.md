In many ways, it's never been easier to start a business and run it profitably than it is right now - so why do we still see businesses failing in the marketplace?

Changes in technology have cut overheads down in terms of marketing your business, managing your business' finances and automating jobs that in days gone by would have been run by staff but failure is still rife in the business community.

There are a variety of reasons, and some are unique to the industry that business is in, so the following is a look at why businesses in the same industry fail.

They're dealing with the same customers. They're facing the same competitive forces. So what makes one fail and the other succeed?

We hope this will share some insight on how your business can avoid the former...

## Masters vs Bunnings

Bunnings has been trading for 66 years, when customers already have exactly what they want under the one roof Master knew they were up for the challenge. Unfortunately, Australia’s newest hardware improvement store couldn’t keep up, 5 years on and $227 billion dollars down Masters giant closed its doors. What went so wrong?

Consumers already had an established hardware offering from Bunnings and Masters failed to deliver a point of difference. 

* Masters were over-optimistic with their roll-out plans
* Selling the wrong products
* Lacklustre customer experience
* Flawed workplace culture

## Eagle Boys vs Dominos

Bunnings has been trading for 66 years, when customers already have exactly what they want under the one roof Master knew they were up for the challenge. Unfortunately, Australia’s newest hardware improvement store couldn’t keep up, 5 years on and $227 billion dollars down Masters giant closed its doors. What went so wrong?

* Dominos used technology as a selling point whilst Eagle Boys lagged behind
* Dominos online services were easier to use from ordering to pick-up and purchase process
* Eagle Boys never actively advertised 
* Eagle Boys never had an offer that invigorated people to buy their pizza, eventually they became non-existent

## Forever 21 vs H&M

Both stores both born in the US and worked their way into Australia, with stores across some of the most popular strips of Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. But what left Forever 21 licking their wounds and closing shop?

* Lack of online presence 
* Not keeping up with seasonal trends and offering clothes that were outdated
* Too much competition (Zara giant started taking over)
* Lacking creativity

As you can see by some of the above examples, without the right business and marketing strategy your business can go from bang to bust quiet easily. Some of the key mistakes we analysed were:

* Bringing in new clients wasn’t a key focus
* Over extending their marketing budget
* Not understand when and how to advertise
* Not embracing the latest technology
* Not taking advantage of some of the marketing tools available
* Not implementing value propositions
