Donated to charity recently? Don't worry, there's no guilt trip coming from us.

As the cost of living grows, hip pockets get tighter and our motivation to exercise our good will through charitable donations inevitably drops too.

So how do charities and not-for-profits rise above and achieve success in this marketplace?

## Stop selling guilt

Unlike this cheery blog post from your Brisbane marketing specialists, if you've been contacted by a charity in recent months and years, you've probably been taken on a long and winding guilt trip.

You've received emotive images and stories of animals, humans and environmental regions in need and told your support is the only thing that can stop this from happening.

Guilt is an effective motivator for these one off interactions, but it doesn't encourage brand loyalty and repeat donations, which is ultimately why charities spend so much on call centre salespeople to make contact with you month after month, after month.

It's all well intentioned and we certainly don't wish to criticise such important work, but it's the wrong marketing approach.

At present, there's very little repeat business in this sector, and that's derivative of the marketing and sales strategy being taken by organisations within the marketplace.

If only they had a marketing strategy of encouraging both those values of loyalty and repeat donor-ship to avoid such crippling sales & staffing overheads...

## Start selling 'member benefits'

One of the biggest marketing mistakes we're observing being made by charities is having no system in place for rewarding the support of its donors.

Now you might say that getting something back isn't the point of a charitable donation, but how many charities would you support if they all came with a set of benefits for you?

We'd wager that number increases and that's advantageous to every charity in the marketplace.

As mentioned at the top of this post, people are more money conscious than ever, so charities and not-for-profits need to focus on creating a strong motive to donate.

In our opinion, it comes down to fundamentally changing the way you view your customers.

* Should they be approached just as donors, that come and go? 
* Or are they members, who should get a set of benefits from you for their continued support?

It may sound trivial but it revolutionises the way an organisation interacts with their market, and its worth every charity and not-for-profit having a good think about this marketing crossroads.

By treating donors as members, the sales pitch changes from asking for their financial support to saying, "sign up today and receive these benefits, for only X per month."

Isn't that a much better phone call or email to receive? We think so.

## The subscription model

Charities can execute this "members > donors" strategy in a couple of ways, the first being via a subscription style approach.

Like with any other subscription, you get a year's worth of benefits for your fee.

We're seeing this a lot more with a 'paycheck pledges' whereby someone will pledge $5 from their monthly paycheck to a charity, that gets direct debited each month.

Provided the numbers are crunched and the benefits not too cumbersome, charities stand to do exceptionally well out of this model, with the true benefit being signing 1000 new members up to a package of this kind, creating a steady, predictable stream of donations.

## The tiered, campaign model

The second way, and most popular in the marketplace is to focus on a key event and sell the market on a tier of benefits, with ascending benefits the higher the donation.

A great example of this working well is how Kickstarter projects recruit donations.

More often than not, you're asking someone to kick in $20, $50, or $100 for a product that's still under development, s
