So you’ve been thinking about creating a viral marketing campaign for your business in 2019, but don’t know where to start? 

Viral marketing if done right has the power to create buzz, spread positive word of mouth and ultimately grow your business. Before getting started on your next viral campaign there is a few important things you should consider first.

# **Targeting**

Targeting is a key element evidenced in successful viral campaigns. Through identifying who your businesses target audience is and their demographics, you can ensure your campaign is sending the right message to the right audience. Furthermore, this will allow you to appeal to the audiences emotions and triggers which drives content sharing to family and friends.

# Pick the right social media

Social media platforms play a significant role in making or breaking a viral campaign. When planning your next viral campaign, it’s important to use social media analytics to understand which platform your target audience frequents the most and what time they are most active. This will ensure when you release your campaign, you have the best chance of content being spread like wildfire. 

The 2016 Netflix ‘Gilmore Girls’ viral Snapchat campaign, which reached more than 500,000 people in one day is a clear example of this. Netflix chose to promote the upcoming film over one day, with Snapchat geo-filters exclusively obtained on coffee cups in participating local US diners with staff dressed like characters from the film. The call for action and sense of urgency created with an expiry feature on the campaign helped fuel its success in going viral.

# Be Bold

The hallmark of a successful viral campaign is also measured in the boldness and ability to think outside of the box to capture audience’s attention. The more your business evokes emotions and moves your target audience, the higher chance you have at making your campaign viral. Furthermore, the importance of sharing a strong opinion and having a theme to your next campaign is undeniable. The key themes we have identified across successful viral campaigns in 2018 were: call to action, humour, story-telling and emotion. 

The power of being bold is clearly exemplified in the recent Tourism Australia advertisement premiered at the 2018 Super Bowl. The advertisement led audience to think it was a sequel to the popular Crocodile Dundee, when it was a promotion for Australia, which led to the campaigns viral success.
