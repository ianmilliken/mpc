What Social Media Best Suits My Business?

So, you’ve decided to take a chance and launch your business on social media – great decision! But before you get started, there’s a few things you should consider before jumping in and setting up your account/s. 

Social Media is no one size fits all package. What works for your next door neighbour, may not work for your business. The most important thing to do before you start up on Social Media is... you guessed it, research. 

Sit down before you jump in and jot down on a notepad your goals for your Social Media, consider: 

•	Who are you going to target? 

•	What Social Networks do they use? 

•	Why do you want to join Social Media? 

•	What do you aim to get from using Social Media (think increased sales, more sign ups, website conversions etc.)? 

•	What brand image to you want to convey? 

•	What budget are you working with? 

•	Do you have time to run Social Media effectively? Or who in your team can manage it? 

Take your time to research your target audience and develop a clear understanding of their demographics, Geographic’s, characteristics and motivations. Having an in-depth understanding of your target audience will allow you to effectively develop your content to appeal to your audience and also work out what Social Media you should use to appeal to your target audience.
