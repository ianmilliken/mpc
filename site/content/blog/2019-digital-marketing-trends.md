As 2018 has recently come to an end, we say goodbye to the trends in the marketing space that have reached the expiration date and welcome 2019 prospects with open arms. 

When building your marketing strategy for 2019, it’s important to understand the new trends in the digital marketplace to remain competitive, build brand awareness and ultimately maximise your return on investment (ROI). These are our digital marketing trend predictions for 2019:

## Micro-Influencer Marketing

The consumer shift towards digital media platforms has fuelled the growing trend of micro-influencer marketing in 2019. Micro-influencer marketing offer businesses the ability to capture a smaller niche audience than macro influencers, with high engagement rates to spread brand awareness.

 The Micro-influencer is defined by high engagement and trust with subscribers and can have anywhere from 5,000 to 500,000 followers. The authenticity of the micro-influencer is the key to their success, with subscribers valuing their brand endorsements highly and allowing it to guide their purchasing decisions. Through working with a group of carefully selected micro-influencers on your next campaign, your business can increase your market reach, whilst maximising ROI.   

## Content Marketing

In 2019, content marketing is predicted to grow rapidly in popularity by businesses across the digital market space.  This has been influenced by a shift in consumer behaviour to place more trust and value on reputable content, rather than traditional advertisements. 

Therefore, the more engaging and informative your digital content is, the higher chance you have, to capture the attention of an online audience. This can be achieved through creating consistent engaging content, which aligns with your key values and goals. 

Through integrating content marketing across digital platforms your business can achieve a marketing strategy that maximises the potential of each online platform. 

## LinkedIn for B2B Marketing

LinkedIn is the world’s largest professional networking site, changing the way brand to brand (B2B) marketing looks like online in 2019. With over 562 million users the site offers new avenues for businesses to create personalised content, whilst increasing engagement and maximising revenue. 

Therefore, it’s recommended that all B2B organisations create a personalised company page, which LinkedIn offers for free. LinkedIn will provide your business with the competitive edge of staying active, present and transparent to potential buyers. This can be achieved through creating a consistent media calendar and active engagement with other businesses, which we can guide you through.  

## Social Media Personalisation

The new year will also see a big push for businesses to personalise social media platform content to create meaningful interactions for consumers. Social media personalisation allows businesses to create a strong connection with consumers, through understanding their specific needs and wants. 

This is as the more personalised the experience the happier the consumer, which in turn drives purchasing behaviour. Through identifying the target market and different segments, you will be better equipped to create personalised content and understand which social media platform will work best to reach the target, which we can help you achieve.

## Video Marketing

Video marketing is also shaping up to be total game changer in 2019 for your business and is quickly becoming the medium of choice. Video is one of the most frequently used forms of content marketing for businesses, boosting engagement and shaping consumer purchasing behaviour. The popularity of video has been significantly influenced by live streaming services across social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. 

Livestreaming encourages increased audience engagement and retains viewers for longer due to the community nature of the viewing experience.  Video marketing offers a big opportunity for your business to expand reach in 2019, we can help you figure out how to create videos for your business based on your brand image and target audience. 

## In Summary

These trends are sure to make a big splash in 2019 and have the power to set your business apart from competitors in the marketplace. When creating your marketing strategy for 2019, it’s important to do your research first and understand how these trends could best benefit your business to build brand awareness and maximise your ROI.
