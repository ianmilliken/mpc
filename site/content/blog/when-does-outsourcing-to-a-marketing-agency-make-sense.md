Outsourcing your business' marketing might not be what you had planned, but it might be just what you need right now.

Based on our 30 years of servicing clients in this space, we often see businesses with the following issues considering outsourcing their marketing to us;

* You don’t know how to best market your business
* You are currently doing some marketing but could do with a more expert approach
* There just isn’t enough time or resources for your team to do it well enough
* You can’t currently afford to hire a full-time marketer or senior marketer

So does hiring a marketing agency make sense for your business? If you want to take advantage of the following benefits, then outsourcing may be a valuable option indeed.

## Trim your marketing costs

Staff; in most situations they're a non-negotiable factor on a business' bottom line - but with marketing they don't always have to be. Paying 1, 2 or even 10 people to look after your internal marketing efforts may not always be the most efficient spend and we'd wager that an agency like our own can see your goals achieved for a lot less, a lot sooner than an in-house team can.

## Access to expertise + experience

Again with an enthusiastic, collaborative team of marketers who feed off of innovation, you’ll be gaining a range of skill-sets, but also the combined experience to back it up. If they’ve had their fair share of clientele, they would have tried and tested methods to get better results for you. In some cases a lone in-house marketer or small team may lack both the experience and the expertise to do so.

Karen Lawson, CEO of CareerOne says that: _“It’s impossible to expect one individual to have the human and mental capital required in all areas of business. You ARE amazing, but be honest and understand what you are good at. Outsource via the task economy or “rent a brain” from other people!”_

## Flexible, strategic use of resources

By freeing up resources many businesses snag the benefits of higher flexibility. You may decide to outsource your digital marketing or strategy to a professional team, whilst leaving reputation management or email marketing in-house. Freeing up core staff responsibilities can allow for access to extra resources and capital for new growth opportunities.

And think of the extra space you’ll save in the office, plus they hassle of managing staff health and safety, sick days or annual leave!

## Expect high-quality performance

With an outside perspective it’s easier to get more objective decision-making on key marketing processes with a wider focus. This means getting results that are tuned to your longer-term marketing and business growth goals. A strong performance also comes with the desire to keep your business as a client. Opt for a marketing agency that will go above and beyond to ensure that your marketing needs are met.

We offer a 3 month, 110% performance guarantee for all our clients. So if you’re not happy with our work we’ll refund you 100% of the cost plus 10% to compensate you for your time. Find out more here.

## Before you outsource: what to consider

To gauge how much external marketing support you’ll need or whether it’s the right fit for your business, you might want to run through the following questions with your team:

* Are you looking to expand or facilitate growth?
* Do you find marketing strategies and technologies complex?
* What is your monthly budget?
* Do you have the customer service capacity to deal with growth?
* Are you transitioning to new platforms or technologies?
* Would you require day-to-day supervision of marketing tasks?
* Do you have an upcoming project with an urgent deadline?
* Do you mind that information about your company is shared with the agency?

## You’re hired!

We’ve looked at how you can leverage outsourcing for part or all of your marketing needs and drive positive results for your business. There are pros and cons both ways of hiring an in-house team or marketing agency, however outsourcing even some of your marketing activities can help you achieve optimal growth through collaborative partnering, innovation, flexibility and quality-orientated work.
