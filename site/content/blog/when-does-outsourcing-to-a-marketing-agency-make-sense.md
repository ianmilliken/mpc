The thought of outsourcing to an unknown marketing agency might leave many business owners will a feeling of dread, or a fierce look of disapproval. Perhaps you’ve heard discouraging stories of an agency turning out to be extremely lazy, or worse, ruining a client’s reputation with a social media rampage worthy of Trump.

Of course, it’s your business and as good marketing is such a critical factor in growing your company for the better, you don’t want to invest in an agency that simply doesn’t cut it.

However, outsourcing marketing activities can provide many benefits and form part of a strong strategy that encourages greater business success. You may be considering outsourcing to an agency if:

* You don’t know how to best market your business
* You are currently doing some marketing but could do with a more expert approach
* There just isn’t enough time or resources for your team to do it well enough
* You can’t currently afford to hire a full-time marketer or senior marketer 

As well as undercutting the costs of hiring an in-house marketing department, getting the dedicated support of external marketing professionals can give businesses access to thought leadership, innovation and best practices that couldn’t be gained with their current resources.

A study from IBM revealed that 36% of company respondents that outsourced were innovators and 37% were growth-seekers, seeing outsourcing as a flexible tool to optimise their businesses.

But if you’re still a bit wary about hiring a professional marketing agency over building an in-house team, you may find it some comfort that multi-million companies including Skype, Slack and even Google can attribute increased revenues and success to outsourcing projects that benefit from collaboration and diverse specialist approaches.

## What a marketing agency can help you with

So does hiring a marketing agency make sense for your business? If you want to take advantage of the following benefits, then outsourcing may be a valuable option indeed.

## The main benefits of outsourcing

As we’ve already touched upon, outsourcing your marketing can be great for the hip-pocket. But it can also provide a range of other advantages that can help you achieve a competitive edge in your market.

## More efficient marketing 

If there’s something that you or your team are unsure of, it might cost a lot of time to get up to speed and ensure that the activity will achieve the results you want. Even an in-house marketing professional may not have the know-how in a certain area to be able to perform it as efficiently as a collaborative team of pros. Added to this a marketing agency is more likely to invest in time-saving technologies and continually renew their practices to get the job done more productively.

## Access to expertise + experience

Again with an enthusiastic, collaborative team of marketers who feed off of innovation, you’ll be gaining a range of skill-sets, but also the combined experience to back it up. If they’ve had their fair share of clientele, they would have tried and tested methods to get better results for you. In some cases a lone in-house marketer or small team may lack both the experience and the expertise to do so.

Karen Lawson, CEO of CareerOne says that: _“It’s impossible to expect one individual to have the human and mental capital required in all areas of business. You ARE amazing, but be honest and understand what you are good at. Outsource via the task economy or “rent a brain” from other people!”_

## Flexible, strategic use of resources

By freeing up resources many businesses snag the benefits of higher flexibility. You may decide to outsource your digital marketing or strategy to a professional team, whilst leaving reputation management or email marketing in-house. Freeing up core staff responsibilities can allow for access to extra resources and capital for new growth opportunities. 

And think of the extra space you’ll save in the office, plus they hassle of managing staff health and safety, sick days or annual leave!

## Expect high-quality performance

With an outside perspective it’s easier to get more objective decision-making on key marketing processes with a wider focus. This means getting results that are tuned to your longer-term marketing and business growth goals. A strong performance also comes with the desire to keep your business as a client. Opt for a marketing agency that will go above and beyond to ensure that your marketing needs are met.

## Before you outsource: what to consider

To gauge how much external marketing support you’ll need or whether it’s the right fit for your business, you might want to run through the following questions with your team:

* Are you looking to expand or facilitate growth?
* Do you find marketing strategies and technologies complex?
* What is your monthly budget?
* Do you have the customer service capacity to deal with growth?
* Are you transitioning to new platforms or technologies?
* Would you require day-to-day supervision of marketing tasks?
* Do you have an upcoming project with an urgent deadline?
* Do you mind that information about your company is shared with the agency?
