brief:

    [Clanwilliam Aged Care](http://www.clanwilliam.com.au/) has a rich history
    of success spanning some 40 years in aged care and nursing, but huge
    competitive forces in the market created a need to become more visible
    within the Brisbane marketplace.


    Clanwilliam engaged with us from March 2017 to develop a marketing and
    branding strategy that would exploit gaps in the competition’s ‘big
    business’ nature, to position the company as the provider that truly ‘cares’
    for families seeking aged care in Brisbane.


    Our ethos is about finding the unique elements of our clients, and pouring
    all the marketing efforts into these qualities, and Clanwilliam’s ‘family
    owned and operated’ nature, provided a huge point of difference in a market
    where families want to ensure their loved ones aren’t just going to be
    another number to huge multinational companies.

    Like most of our briefs, our work with Clanwilliam began with a [strategy
    workshop](https://marketplacestrategysolutions.com.au/services/marketing-strategy/)
    in which the following became the way forward;


    * Via a company re-brand, position Clanwilliam as the ‘family provider’ in a
    market full of large corporate players in the Brisbane marketplace

    * The market has grown some distrust for bigger providers amid the treatment
    of residents so displaying the family force behind the company was crucial
    to conveying the level of care and trust families can place in Clanwilliam

    * Target all marketing activities, not at the 70-80 plus age demographic,
    but at the 40-50 age bracket, knowing that sons and daughters often have to
    make the first move to place parents in aged care

    * Understanding that it would be difficult to compete with the marketing
    budgets of competitors like Bupa, Aveo, our strategy digitally was to target
    specific searches made by Brisbane users that would bring the best results
    and prospective residents through the website.

    * Funnel almost all marketing spend into activities that increase the
    company’s visibility online. Google AdWords, SEO, more testimonials on
    Google Reviews etc.

    We carried out a complete marketing and branding overhaul to address the
    client’s low awareness in the expanding Brisbane aged care marketplace, with
    excellent results for their facilities:


    * Directed 1500+ online users at Clanwilliam’s website over a 3 month period

    * Funnelled 580 unique users  from our Google ads direct to two of their
    facilities with admissions needs

    * Made the company visible to the Brisbane market online by improving
    organic search rankings from beyond Page 4 to Page 1 

    * Achieved AdWords click through rate 5x better than ‘health and medical’
    industry average

    * Once a non-existent sales tool, now over 10% of visitors to the contact
    page leave their details and become qualified sales leads

    * Grew the number of people visiting the website without increasing $$$


    To find out more, you can [visit their
    website](http://www.clanwilliam.com.au/), which we developed in line with
    their goal to be seen as the 'family player' and unique to the competition
    in every way.
