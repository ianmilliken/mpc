client: Clanwilliam Aged care
brief:
  body: >-
    Clanwilliam Aged Care has a rich history of success spanning some 40 years
    in aged care and nursing, but huge competitive forces in the market created
    a need to become more visible within the marketplace.

     

    Clanwilliam engaged with MPC from March 2017 to develop a marketing and
    branding strategy that would exploit gaps in the competitor’s branding and
    ‘big business’ nature, to position the company as the provider that truly
    ‘cares’.




    Our ethos is about finding the unique elements of our clients, and pouring
    all the marketing efforts into these qualities, and Clanwilliam’s ‘family
    owned and operated’ nature, provided a huge point of difference in a market
    where families want to ensure their loved ones aren’t just going to be
    another number to huge multinational companies.

    Like most of our briefs, our work with Clanwilliam began with a strategy
    workshop including the following steps:


    From the workshop we focused on getting the brand right, and auditing their
    current digital performance in line with what is best practice for the aged
    care industry.


    Intensive market research followed in what was a critical step to help
    understand what competitors were performing the best, across which popular
    searches on Google.


    Understanding that it would be difficult to compete with the marketing
    budgets of competitors like Bupa, Aveo, our strategy digitally was to target
    specific searches that would bring the best results and prospective
    residents through the website.


    From there, we rolled out a new website, pursued digital advertising on
    Google, to ensure the company appeared at the top of page 1 on aged care
    related searches, thus giving the brand HUGE visibility in the online
    marketplace.

    Since June 2017, Oxmar Properties has continued to grow and has been heavily
    featured in two WBO Welterweight World Championship bouts as a major
    sponsor. Their ‘celebrity endorsement’ using Jeff Horn in a television
    commercial MPC produced and coordinated saw roughly 1.3 million views over
    two weeks, within the designated target market 25-54 years old.

     

    A targeted press insert campaign MPC produced and coordinated also saw major
    spikes in Google search results for ‘Oxmar Properties’ on the day it was
    published within a Newscorp publication.

     

    MPC continues to oversee their local area marketing activities and
