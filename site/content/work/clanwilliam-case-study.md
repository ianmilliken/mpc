client: Clanwilliam Aged care
brief:
  body: >-
    Clanwilliam Aged Care has a rich history of success spanning some 40 years
    in aged care and nursing, but huge competitive forces in the market created
    a need to become more visible within the marketplace.

     

    Clanwilliam engaged with us from March 2017 to develop a marketing and
    branding strategy that would exploit gaps in the competitor’s branding and
    ‘big business’ nature, to position the company as the provider that truly
    ‘cares’.




    Our ethos is about finding the unique elements of our clients, and pouring
    all the marketing efforts into these qualities, and Clanwilliam’s ‘family
    owned and operated’ nature, provided a huge point of difference in a market
    where families want to ensure their loved ones aren’t just going to be
    another number to huge multinational companies.

    Like most of our briefs, our work with Clanwilliam began with a strategy
    workshop in which the following became the way forward;


    * Via a company re-brand, position Clanwilliam as the ‘family provider’ in a
    market full of large corporate players

    * The market has grown some distrust for bigger providers amid the treatment
    of residents so displaying the family force behind the company was crucial
    to conveying the level of care and trust families can place in Clanwilliam

    * Target all marketing activities, not at the 70-80 plus age demographic,
    but at the 40-50, knowing that sons and daughters often have to make the
    first move to place parents in Aged Care

    * Understanding that it would be difficult to compete with the marketing
    budgets of competitors like Bupa, Aveo, our strategy digitally was to target
    specific searches that would bring the best results and prospective
    residents through the website.

    * Funnel almost all marketing spend into activities that increase the
    company’s visibility online. Google AdWords, SEO, more testimonials on
    Google Reviews etc.

    We carried out a complete marketing and branding overhaul to address the
    client’s low awareness in the expanding Aged Care marketplace, with
    excellent results for their branches:


    * Directed 1500+ online users at Clanwilliam’s website over a 3 month period

    * 580 unique users clicked from our Google ads direct to the campaign
    landing pages, throughout our promotion of two feature facilities

    * Made the company visible to the market online by improving organic search
    rankings from beyond Page 4 to Page 1 

    * Achieved AdWords click through rate 5x better than ‘health and medical’
    industry average

    * Once a non-existent sales tool, now over 10% of visitors to the contact
    page leave their details and become qualified sales leads

    * Grew the number of people visiting the website without increasing $$$
