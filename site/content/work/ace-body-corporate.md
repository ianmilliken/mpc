brief:
  body: >-
    Ace Body Corporate Management is one of Australia’s largest and finest body
    corporate companies, but there’s one small problem, people don’t have a lot
    of warmth or trust even for the best body corporates.


    “They didn’t fix the tap on time!” “The neighbours dogs bark!” You’ve heard
    it all before and so have their team, which manages a combined total of
    60,000 lots and $20 billion worth of property.


    In order to help the business grow its franchise base from 115 towards the
    200 market over the next decade, Ace contacted us to position them as the
    ‘trustworthy, professional’ body corporate company, by way of some strategic
    media & communications work.

solution:
  body: "Over 7 million Australians now live in a body corporate and so we devised an ongoing media & communications campaign, to put Ace on the screens and newspapers of these Australians living in apartments and units.\n\nRead an article on Airbnb in the last couple of years? How about the keeping of pets in apartments? Chances are you’ve unwittingly seen and heard from Ace on what you need to know about the topic and how you can overcome your issues.\n\n* Following two strategy meetings, Ace engaged Marketplace to drive the following tasks\r\n* Define Ace’s key messages, unique selling proposition (USP) and points of difference\r\n* Develop strategic press campaigns to build brand exposure\r\n* Draft media material to be published\r\n* Build the Ace ‘brand’ and position the developer as a ‘thought leader’ for issues that matter to apartment owners\r\n* Build the individual profile of Ace’s CEO as the expert in the field\r\n* Overhaul Ace’s digital communications with the market on social media"
results:
  body: "“We’ve got a goal to be the largest strata management company in Australia by 2020, and the ongoing strategic marketing direction that Marketplace provides is a big part of why we’re confident we’ll get to this mark.”\r\n\n“Pat and his team understand how to best tailor marketing programs to our franchise network, and it is that innate understanding of where the opportunities lie for our brand that has been one of the most invaluable things they have brought to the table.”\r\n\n_Stephen Raff - CEO _\n\n## 2018 and beyond\r\n\n\n\nLike many of our clients, Ace came to Marketplace for one service, and stands here today with a more comprehensive, all encompassing brief that addresses ALL of their marketing needs.\r\n\nThanks to the results of the media & communications campaign, the company is now well positioned as a leading authority on consumer issues within the market and so the attention of marketing activities must go elsewhere.\r\n\nThis year we will be embarking on a delivery local area marketing plans to each franchisee within the 115 strong Ace network and see us provide the following services."
