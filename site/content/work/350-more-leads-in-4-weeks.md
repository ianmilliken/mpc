brief:
  body: >-
    No matter what industry you're in, getting more leads is a marketing result
    that speaks volumes.


    And it's precisely the result we delivered to the Darwin franchise of long
    term client Ace Body Corporate Management.


    Having only received the two quote requests for 2018, we structured a Google
    AdWords campaign for their business tasked with placing their business at
    the top of relevant Google searches within their market.

solution:
  body: >-
    'Body corporate fees', 'body corporate complaints' and others were targeted
    by us in the hope of getting apartment owners to 'Switch to Ace'.


    We targeted these keywords specifically, knowing they were searched over
    1000 times a month, and importanly the hallmark of a property owner clearly
    disgruntled with their current management.


    Competition is fierce in the body corporate industry, with over 2 million
    Australians living in apartments and units - and our strategies regarding
    this AdWords campaign proved a huge advantage.
