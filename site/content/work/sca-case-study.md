client: Strata Community Association
brief:
  body: >-
    National media and digital communications work to see our client’s
    organisation become the ‘go to’ public voice for issues concerning their
    industry.




    Strata Community Association is the peak professional body for Australia’s
    $1.2 trillion strata title sector, with 3,300 members managing the
    properties of 7 million Australians. 




    If you live in an apartment or townhouse, there’s an 85% chance your body
    corporate manager is a member of SCA, and their task to us was to ensure
    that on issues concerning their industry, national, state and local media
    would contact them FIRST, before competing organisations.




    Issues like flammable cladding, the rise of Airbnb, whether pets should be
    allowed in apartment blocks are just a handful of the issues that SCA is now
    a lead industry voice on, and importantly a key consultant to Government on,
    thanks to media coverage and exposure generated for their brand.

    The ability of SCA to grow its member base relied on the public seeing its
    members as more professional or more legitimate than those professionals not
    affiliated with the organisation. So we decided to pair the organisation
    with the biggest news stories in the industry, and by extension, make them a
    ‘go to’ for information about apartment living. 




    The strategy being that when the time came to appoint a strata manager,
    apartment owners would go with the managers they could trust, SCA members.




    The Australian wants a commentary piece on what needs to happen about
    flammable cladding? We ensured SCA had the opportunity to speak.




    The Courier Mail wants a hot take on whether pets should be allowed in
    apartments? We ensured SCA was the leading voice on this issue.
