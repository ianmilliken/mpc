    Property sells itself right? WRONG.


    In the case of Noosa NorthRise, a house and land development on Queensland's
    Sunshine Coast, that was certainly the issue their internal marketing team
    encountered.


    Located north of the Noosa river, in an idyllic yet out of the way location,
    the property group who built the community actually went into receivership
    it proved such a problem project.


    So when the receivers took ownership of the development, still with some 40
    lots left to sell, they engaged us to deliver a sales & marketing strategy
    that would turn this ship around.

  body: >-
    We pride ourselves on finding a marketing solution where other agencies
    can't and this particular case study is one we use to illustrate that,


    In the words of our Managing Director, "we don't sell tomatoes, we sell
    ideas" and in this case the idea involved stepping deep into the target
    market's shoes, and marketing to them through very specific channels.


    Knowing that prospective buyers may be scared away by the limited access
    that regions north of the Noosa River have, we coordinated a B2B marketing
    campaign with all the 4WD dealerships and mechanics north of Brisbane and on
    the Sunshine Coast to target drivers who wouldn't be fussed by the 4WD only
    access that parts of Noosa National Park have.


    What previous teams had failed to realise was that this project attracted a
    niche market, and by advertising in the waiting rooms of key 4WD dealerships
    and mechanics, we were able to generate the necessary leads for the sales
    team to get buyers in the door
results:
  body: |-
    * Generated over 100 qualified sales leads
    * Facilitated 40 sales at 'impossible' project
    * Deliver a 'waiting list' of leads for stage 2 development
