    Oxmar Properties is a SME land developer based in North Brisbane. Despite
    their strong portfolio in SEQ, they struggled to gain increased brand
    recognition in the local market and online.


    Oxmar Properties engaged with MPC from June 2017 to develop a comprehensive
    brand building exercise that would leverage Director Phil Murphy’s
    sponsorship of WBO Welterweight World Champion Jeff Horn. We also created an
    in-depth digital marketing strategy in line with a review of Oxmar’s
    existing digital practices.

    Following two strategy meetings run by MPC, Oxmar Properties were eager to
    participate in a half-day workshop to generate ideas for better digital
    marketing practice. Their tailored workshop included the following steps:


    * Define Oxmar’s key messages, unique selling proposition (USP) and points
    of difference

    * Build the Oxmar ‘brand’ and position the developer as an industry leader

    * Build the individual profile of Phil Murphy as expert in the field

    * Create a formalised digital marketing strategy for boosting sales and
    leveraging increased brand exposure

    * Identify opportunities for Oxmar

    * Overhaul Oxmar’s online practices

    * Develop strategic press campaigns to build brand exposure

    * Draft media material to be published

    * Develop television commercial for Channel 7 Brisbane

    * Consistently present out-of-the-box ideas to break through tight
    competition

    Since June 2017, Oxmar Properties has continued to grow and has been heavily
    featured in two WBO Welterweight World Championship bouts as a major
    sponsor. Their ‘celebrity endorsement’ using Jeff Horn in a television
    commercial MPC produced and coordinated saw roughly 1.3 million views over
    two weeks, within the designated target market 25-54 years old.


    A targeted press insert campaign MPC produced and coordinated also saw major
    spikes in Google search results for ‘Oxmar Properties’ on the day it was
    published within a Newscorp publication.


    MPC continues to oversee their marketing and press activities; ensuring that
    their activities are on track and run smoothly. We are working with Oxmar to
    provide media relations support; and offering new business opportunities and
    assistance wherever possible.
