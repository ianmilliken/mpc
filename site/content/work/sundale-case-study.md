brief:
  body: >-
    Sundale is a not-for-profit aged care facility developer and provider
    operating across Queensland and they offer communities and specialised care
    to the elderly. Sundale have been running a successful organisation spanning
    over 5 decades, however they were lacking in an online/digital capacity.

     

    Sundale engaged with MPC mid-2017 to develop and build a comprehensive
    website for one of their new communities. MPC were then further engaged by
    Sundale in November 2017 to begin planning a Christmas event to capitalise
    on attendees and convert them into sales.

    Following strategy meetings run by MPC, Sundale were eager to engage our
    services to streamline their digital marketing practice and customer
    nurturing processes.

     

    We developed a digital marketing strategy within budget and the designated
    timeline to deliver a modern, easy to replicate platform which formed a new
    foundation for Sundale’s websites. The website maintained Sundale’s brand
    guidelines and complimented the new community.

     

    For the Christmas event, MPC wrote, designed and submitted a targeted press
    and flyer campaign to maximise awareness in a short amount of time. MPC also
    coordinated the event running in conjunction with a consultant from Sundale.
